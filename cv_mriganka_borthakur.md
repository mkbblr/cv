**M2M Chip Applications** *(Jun 2015 - Jan 2016)*

	Team Size: 4, Role: Technical Project Leader, 
	Technologies: C, AOSP, JTAG, C++, Qt

This proect involved developing utility libraries like http, smtp, cmux (over serial) for a low level chipset. The chipset runs embedded android(AOSP) on application processor. Also integrated device management modules into modem (running Qualcom REX OS on a separate processor). Mostly used C, cross compilers toolchains from ARM, JTAG for debugging using TRACE32 ICD. Also developed cmux PC client application with Qt and libcmux for serial port multiplexing.



**Connection Manager for USB Datacards** *(Apr 2012 - May 2015)*  	

	Team Size: 4, Role: Technical Project Leader, 
	Technologies: C++, Qt

This project involved developing multi-platform (win, linux, mac) connection manager for plug and play USB modems.

Playing the role of technical leader for a team of 4 people. Responsible for design and
delivery of software for each India Open Market MBB product release. Involves in communication
with marketing, firmware, device driver and other teams and technical management of the India
Software Development team to ensure timely delivery. Moreover, as a part of introduction of micro-
innovations, responsible for collecting, enriching new ideas and suggestions, analyze, implement and release them to India Open Market MBB products after close consultation with product portfolio
management departments.

**Soft WiFi Addon for USB Datacards** *(April-2011 - March-2012)* 

	Team Size: 5, Role: Technical Project Leader, 
	Technologies: C++, QT,Win32 Native WiFi & Internet Connection Sharing API)

The objective was to provide a utility addon for Huawei Mobile Broadband connection manager software which will enable user to share the internet connection over WiFi of the laptop to other devices.

As a technical leader for a team of 5 members, participated in enrichment of the initial idea and feasibility study, requirement gathering and subsequent discussions. Created the high level design of the Software and partially implemented the key modules. Monitored the project implementation and day to day progress, co-ordinated with testing, marketing and QA teams to ensure timely delivery.


**Portable Connection Manager for USB Datacards** *(April-2009 - March-2011)* 

	Team Size: 6, Role: Senior Software Developer, 
	Technologies: C++, Qt, Win32, MFC, WinDDK, NSIS, Apache-ANT

This involved developing a portable connection manager that can comes with the USB modem and starts as we plugin the USB modem without any installation. Also once usage is complete, it leaves no trace on that computer. Adding an SD card to the device, even all userdata can be stored in it. Moreover, user can carry all his favourit apps in the SD card (portableapps.com fromat) and use it in any computer without leaving any trace. all apps are run within the sandbox environment provided by the connection manager software. 

As a senior developer, designed and implemented the key modules like application launcher,
SD card security and platform utilities, coordinated with different teams including firmware, driver
and others to ensure timely integration in the initial phase. Later handled post release product

customizations for China market which involved a lot of interaction with marketing and third-party
application vendors.

**uiOne Multimedia** *(April-2008 - March-2009)* 

	Team Size: 6, Role: Software Developer, 
	Technologies: C++, BREW, BUIW, uiOne, QXDM, TRACE32 ICD)

Objective was to deliver the multimedia framework for uiOne based mobile handset family, with the feature/design changes from original uiOne module.

The project has already almost completed the initial coding phase. However, performance of the current system was unacceptably poor to be useable in a mobile device. Assigned the task to understand the existing design and code and improve the same of an acceptable performance. Since there was no good profiling tool available under the target environment, designed a selective profiling mechanism with \_penter and \_pexit hooks and used the same to identify the hot-spots. Improved the DB performance by optimizing the startup synchronization to continue in background. Updated DB schema for optimization. Replaced some time consuming SQL queries with in-memory
operations with effective caching. In later stage taken up other modules like music browser, syncML and handled new requirements for some time.


**XML parser** *(2008/2009)*
	Team Size: 1, Role: Software Developer, 
	Technologies: C, REX-OS, QXDM, TRACE32 ICD


**Automated Test Tool - for Feature Phone** *(April-2006 - March-2008)* 

	Team Size: 3, Role: Software Developer, 
	Technologies: C++,BREW, REX, QXDM, TRACE32 ICD, Win32, MFC)

Objective was to deliver an automated test tool to automate the GUI and other test cases for Mobile Handset Applications in Huawei handsets. 

Involved from the very beginning including requirement discussion and initial prototyping
and design discussion. Implemented key modules and delivered and maintained the same for use by
different teams. Helped HQ product teams to integrate the same in different product lines.
