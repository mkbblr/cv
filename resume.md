The project has already almost completed the initial coding phase. However, performance of the current system was very poor to be useable in a mobile device. Assigned the task to understand the existing design and code and improve the same of an acceptable performance. Since there was no good profiling tool available under the target environment, designed a selective profiling mechanism with \_penter and \_pexit hooks and used the same to identify the hot-spots. Improved the DB performance by optimizing the startup synchronization to continue in background. Updated DB schema for optimization. Replaced some time consuming SQL queries with in-memory operations with effective caching.
